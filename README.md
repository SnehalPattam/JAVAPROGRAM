        <h1> What Is Java Programming ?</h1>
        <p>Java is a object oriented programming language.Developed by <b>Sun Microsystem</b> in 1995. Java is invented
            by James Ghosing (Father of Java) and aquire by the ORACLE.Java is a high-level, class-based,
            object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as
            possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere
            (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to
            recompile.</p>

        <h3>1.Object oriented</h3>

        <p>In java every thing is an object.object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data
            and methods.Java Language is considered an object-oriented language because it is based on the concept of
            objects and classes. Without the creation of objects and classes, it is impossible to write any code in
            Java.
        <h4>Types of Object Oriented Programming</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>2.Simple</h3>
        <p>It is easy to learn. No need to add header files. And also there is no need of pointer concepts there are no
            pre-equistics.Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn
            than other programming languages. Java is object-oriented. This allows you to create modular programs and
            reusable code.</p>

        <h3>3.Plateform Independent</h3>
        <p>Java is platform-independent because it uses a virtual machine.Java follows a <b>WORA</b> prrinciple (Write
            Once Write Anywhere that means program can run in any operating system.It does not depend on any type of
            platform.</p>

        <h3>4.Neutral or Architecture Neutral.</h3>
        <p>If there is change in the RAM of laptop Or machine then also there is no change in the Java program.Java
            allows its application to compile on one hardware architecture and to execute on another hardware
            architecture.</p>

        <h3>5.Portable</h3>
        <p>Portable means the conversion of source code to the byte code.Java is known as a "portable language" because
            Java code can execute on all major platforms. </p>

        <h3>6.Secure</h3>
        <p>Java is a very secure. Thats why Java mostly used in a banking industry.The JDK is designed with a strong
            emphasis on security. At its core, the Java language itself is type-safe and provides automatic garbage
            collection, enhancing the robustness of application code.</p>

        <h3>7.Multithreaded</h3>
        <p>Java is a multithreaded. means we can perfoem the multiple tasks simultenously.Multithreading saves time as
            you can perform multiple operations together. The threads are independent, so it does not block the user to
            perform multiple operations at the same time and also, if an exception occurs in a single thread, it does
            not affect other threads.</p>

        <h3>8.Robust</h3>
        <p>Basically, robust means their is no need of the pointer concepts. And the garbage collector work
            automatically.Java is robust because it utilizes strong memory management. There is an absence of pointers
            that bypasses security dilemmas. There is automatic garbage collection in Java which runs on the Java
            Virtual Machine to eliminate objects which are not being accepted by a Java application anymore.</p>

        <h3>9.Interpreted</h3>
        <p>Interpreted means the process of converting byte code into a machine code. because its source code is first
            compiled into a binary byte-code.</p>
